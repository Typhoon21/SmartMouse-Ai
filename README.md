# SmartMouse-Ai
Mouse trying to collect cheese while avoiding traps.
The game is played by ai using Deep Q Learning and neural network. The player(Mouse) only knows about how far it is away from the goal(you can say it smells) and sees only front in a range(visualized in light gray color). Depending on these inputs ai decides what to do and how to do it in time. You can save and load the last state of the neural network.

Used Frameworks:
Torch, Kivy
